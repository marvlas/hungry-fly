# Hungry Fly

## Description
The player moves across the board by using the mouse or arrow keys, and needs to hit targets popping up randomly on the board and disappearing after a few secs. The player's life decreases automatically after a certain amount of time. If player hits targets life points increase, if players hit false targets the player's life decreases. When the life score is 0 the game is over. There is a timer for records.
